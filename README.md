# Digital Trust for Places and Routines

[Digital Trust for Places and Routines](https://dtpr.helpfulplaces.com/) is an open-source communication standard for digital technology that enables agency for people in the real world. We believe that by first enabling transparency and understanding, we can increase accountability and human agency so that there can be trust in digital technology.

For an overview of the open-source communication standard, and our five year vision of what could be possible if DTPR is widely adopted, see our website at [dtpr.helpfulplaces.com](https://dtpr.helpfulplaces.com)

This project began as [Designing for Digital Transparency in the Public Realm](https://github.com/sidewalklabs/dtpr). In 2019, experts came together in cities around the world in co-design sessions to collaborate and prototype an initial set of open communication standards for digital transparency in the public realm. In 2020, this initial draft was refined through several cycles of online expert charrettes and small meetings, iterative prototype development, and longitudinal inclusive usability and concept testing. 

These draft standards, as well as all the co-design activities and materials that generated them, are publicly and freely available for others to adopt, use, and build upon. Further development of these draft standards are currently being stewarded by Helpful Places and an emerging coalition of partners and collaborators. 


**We’re looking for partners who want to advance the use and adoption of these standards in the public realm. Please get in touch at dtpr@helpfulplaces.com.**

## The DTPR Design Patterns and Prototypes - V2

There are four major components to DTPR - **icons**, a **signage system**, and a **digital channel** for communication - which together, help visualize and convey a **taxonomy of key concepts**.

### Icons

You can download the latest set of the [icon files and visual system](https://github.com/helpful-places/dtpr/tree/master/dtpr_icons) from Github.

### Design Guide

The [design guide](https://github.com/sidewalklabs/dtpr/blob/master/dtpr_designguide/DTPR_Design_Guide.pdf) has what you need to know in order to actually create signs using the icons or add the icons to existing signage. This has not changed since the initial V1 release.

### Taxonomy

The taxonomy is the full set of definitions on which the icons are based. These definitions are also used in the prototype of the digital channel. The work-in-progress V2 draft of the taxonomy and the associated icons are managed in an Airtable, which you can see [here](https://airtable.com/shrgffVQQN7CsFhFt). Please note this is an active work in progress! 

### Prototype for the Digital Channel

When you scan a QR code on a sign, it brings you to a webpage where you get more information. You can see the [V1 prototype for the digital channel](https://dtpr.sidewalklabs.com/dtpr_prototype) - it’s set up for 307, Sidewalk Labs’ Toronto office and experimental workspace. Here’s the [V1 source code](https://github.com/sidewalklabs/dtpr/tree/master/dtpr_prototype).

## Co-Design Kit

In the course of developing the initial prototypes, we developed materials and a facilitation guide that was used to run our co-design sessions. All the materials are provided [here](https://github.com/sidewalklabs/dtpr/tree/master/dtpr_codesignkit) so that anyone, anywhere, can take up these tools and use them to engage in this crucial topic. This is unchanged since V1.

## Contributors

The development of these design patterns and prototypes would not have been possible without the large number of contributors who invested their expertise and time in this project. They are listed [here](contributors.md).
